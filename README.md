	- for the analytics task I picked exoplanets dataset from kaggle.com since it has more numerical columnes that can be manipulated
	- initialized the libraries 
	- loaded the dataset in dataframe
	- cleaned the data, by making some new columns, some columnes were dropped
	- showed correlations between dataset features
	- preprocessed and scaled data for further analysis
	- reduced dimensions to 3, then ploted them in 2D and 3D
	- using elbow method clusterized the dataset and colored the clusters in 3D ploted
	- made the model evaluation by different plots
	- few more insights containing useful information about dataset
	- generated a sweetviz report in the notebook
	- conclusion
